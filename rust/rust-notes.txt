Rust annotations

Cargo is Rust's build system and package manager.

Data types, as String, have methods and functions associated to them

In Rust, variables are immutable by default.

Referenes are also immutables bu default.

A variable can be mutable if the word "mut" were used.

read_line() reads a value from imput, but also returns a type

Result types are enumerations(enums), which can have a fixed set of possibilities know as variants.

In some cases, the Result type have the purpose of encode error-handling information.

Results's variantes are Ok or Err. Ok = successful, wiht the value inside Ok. Err means that operation failed, and Err contains information about how or why the operation failed.

If the Result is Ok, than the value expected is send to te program; else, using the expect() method, the error is hadled by the method.

Ordering = a type, a enum, which has the Less, Greater and Equal variants. It's is used to compare values, and it is called with the "use std::cmp:Ordering"

cmp(like in guess.cmp(&secret_number)) = method compare, in which yo can compare two things. It returns a Ordering type.

match = expression that decides what to do next based on some return

A match expression is made up of arms. An arm consists of a pattern to match against and the code that should be run if the value given to match fits that arm's pattern.
